# Configure RBAC permissions

`Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Kubernetes` uses the service account to query Kubernetes information to enhance telemetries. It is important to have proper permissions configured for Kubernetes-related resources like Node, Pod, and so on to be fetched correctly.

In this post, we will start by describing a method to correctly configure the permissions for an RBAC-enabled cluster. And then share troubleshooting guidance.

## Assumptions

In this demo, we will have the following assumptions. Please change the related values accordingly:

* The application will be deployed to namespace `ai-k8s-demo`.
* The application will leverage the `default` service account.

## Setup the permissions for the service account

Depending on various considerations, there could be different strategies to set up the permissions for your service account. Here we list 2 common possibilities, as examples.

* If you want to get the Node information along with other resource info like Pod, Deployment, and so on, a ClusterRole and a ClusterRoleBinding are required, and here's how to do it:

  * Create a yaml file, [sa-role.yaml](./sa-role.yaml) for example. We will deploy it when it is ready.

      * Write spec to define a cluster role, name it `appinsights-k8s-property-reader` for example:
   
          ```yaml
           kind: ClusterRole
           apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
           metadata:
             # "namespace" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced
             name: appinsights-k8s-property-reader
           rules:
           - apiGroups: ["", "apps"]
             resources: ["pods", "nodes", "replicasets", "deployments"]
             verbs: ["get", "list"]
          ```
          That spec defines the name of the role, and what permission does the role has, for example, list pods.

          You don't have to use the exact name, but you will need to making sure the name is referenced correctly in the following steps.

      * Append a Cluster role binding spec:

          ```yaml
          ---
          # actual binding to the role
          kind: ClusterRoleBinding
          apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
          metadata:
            name: appinsights-k8s-property-reader-binding
          subjects:
          - kind: ServiceAccount
            name: default
            namespace: ai-k8s-demo
          roleRef:
            kind: ClusterRole
            name: appinsights-k8s-property-reader
            apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          ```

      That is to grant the role of `appinsights-k8s-property-reader` to the default service account in the namespace of `ai-k8s-demo`.

  * If you don't want to create a Cluster Role, it is also possible to use Role and RoleBinding starting with Application Insights for Kubernetes 2.0.6+. Follow the example in [sa-role-none-cluster.yaml](./sa-role-none-cluster.yaml). In that case, you will not have node info on the telemetries.

* Now you can deploy it:

    ```shell
    kubectl create -f `sa-role.yaml`
    ```
    See [sa-role.yaml](sa-role.yaml) for a full example.

## Ad-hoc troubleshooting for permission

Kubectl provides an `auth --can-i` subcommand for troubleshooting permissions. It supports impersonating the service account. We can leverage it for permission troubleshooting, for example:

```shell
kubectl auth can-i list pod --namespace ai-k8s-demo --as system:serviceaccount:ai-k8s-demo:default
```

There are several arguments there, let's break it down:

* **--namespace ai-k8s-demo**: This is the target namespace;
* **--as system:serviceaccount:ai-k8s-demo:default**: Check permission for `default` service account in namespace of `ai-k8s-demo`.

The response for the command-line will simply be `yes` or `no`, for example:

```shell
$ kubectl auth can-i list pod --namespace ai-k8s-demo --as system:serviceaccount:ai-k8s-demo:default
yes
```

## Use SubjectAccessReview

Kubernetes also provides `SubjectAccessReview` to check permission for a given user on the target resource.

### Basic usage

* Create a yaml file like `subject-access-review.yaml` for example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: SubjectAccessReview
    spec:
    resourceAttributes:
        group: "apps"
        resource: pods
        verb: list
        namespace: ai-k8s-demo
    user: system:serviceaccount:ai-k8s-demo:default # service account in default namespace and named default
    ```
* Deploy and output the content as yaml:

    ```shell
    kubectl create -f subject-access-review.yaml -o yaml
    ```
    When the permission is configured correctly, it will give out detailed descriptions like this:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: SubjectAccessReview
    metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    spec:
    resourceAttributes:
        namespace: ai-k8s-demo
        resource: pods
        verb: list
    user: system:serviceaccount:ai-k8s-demo:default
    status:
    allowed: true
    reason: 'RBAC: allowed by ClusterRoleBinding "appinsights-k8s-property-reader-binding"
        of ClusterRole "appinsights-k8s-property-reader" to ServiceAccount "ai-k8s-demo/default"'
    ```

    Or, lack of permission:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: SubjectAccessReview
    metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    spec:
    resourceAttributes:
        namespace: ai-k8s-demo
        resource: pods
        verb: list
    user: system:serviceaccount:ai-k8s-demo:default
    status:
    allowed: false
    ```

    To make it easier, we provide 2 pre-built yaml for you to leverage:

    * [subject-access-review-key.yaml](./subject-access-review-key.yaml): a subset of permissions for probing the RBAC settings.
    * [subject-access-review-full.yaml](./subject-access-review-full.yaml): a full list of all permissions needed for RBAC settings in case any specific permission is missing.
